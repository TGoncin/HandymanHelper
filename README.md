# HandymanHelper

Handymans Helper is a home services marketplace that connects skilled tradespeople with clients who want quality work at a fair, transparent price.

Refined description
Handymans Helper is a software platform that bridges the gap between clients and trusted local pros, making it easier than ever to turn experience, knowledge, and craftsmanship into real, paid work.

Instead of struggling with overpriced ads or platforms that ban service posts, Handymans Helper gives renovators, tradespeople, and small companies a dedicated space to market themselves and build long-term client relationships.

Every user has an account, but service providers go through a rigorous validation and verification process to earn trust.
​
They can upload tickets and credentials (such as graduation papers or journeyman certificates), which must be verified before being shown to clients.
​

Service providers showcase prior and completed projects with photos or videos, along with client-approved project highlights, reviews, and ratings.

Clients can quickly see who they’re dealing with, compare quality, and choose the helper whose profile best matches the work they need done.

Contact details, ratings, and two-way reviews (clients review helpers, and helpers review clients) create a transparent, trust-first environment.

Both companies and individuals can sign up, and services are organized into clear categories so users can easily find exactly what they need.

The standout feature is the built-in bidding auction: clients post the job they want done, review interested helpers’ profiles, and then approve who can bid.

Approved Handymans Helpers submit bids, and the client can choose the best fit—whether that’s the lowest price, the strongest portfolio, or the highest rating.

Handymans Helper gives homeowners and property managers a simple way to find reliable local help, while giving tradespeople a fair, direct way to win work without fighting broken algorithms or overpriced ads.

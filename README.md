  <h2 align="center">Project Abstract</h2>
<br> 

<br> 
People often struggle with ability to find work, or good quality work that they want done since the industry continues to widen the gap of communication. Contractors continue to struggle through the unreliable and lack of transparent advertising that many mediums offer to bridge the gap of communication between these groups. Existing platforms often prioritize ad revenue and algorithms over providing the best service/product that one pays for and believes they are receiving. This forms an absence of trust, leaving skilled renovators, contractors, artists and alike competing for visibility rather than work quality.
<br>
<br>
Handyman Helper was conceived as a practical solution to bridge this divide. It provides a digital marketplace where local professionals can connect directly with clients seeking reliable, fair priced services. It is a hub statued as a services marketplace that connects skilled tradespeople with clients who want quality work at a fair, transparent price.
<br>
<br>
The project builds upon modern marketplace frameworks while incorporating unique verification and transparency tools designed specifically for contracting jobs.
<br>
<br>
This initiative aims to empower independent workers, small businesses and clients, while simplifying the process for individuals to obtain the best value for their dollar.
<br>
<br>
Our team had a vision where workers focused on the quality of their craftsmanship rather than the perpetual hamster wheel of battling for visability through many, if not all forms of advertisement; entirely cutting out the middleman that many feel doesn't hold the honest and feduciary responsibilities one expects and by law is required to.
<br>
<br>
The demand for verified, skilled help in civilian services has never been higher. However, most current online platforms fail to:
<br>
<br>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">

  <li><strong>Allow contractors to post for free</strong>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
        Many listings cancel or ban your advertising to force a payment plan for their own advertising with sub-optimal results</li></ul>
            <span style="font-size: 1em;">&nbsp;</span>

  <li><strong>Two-way, verified rating system</strong>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
        Upon an agreement, both parties agree through the application on a deal being struck, this preventative measure allows both parties to rate one anothers experience through the interaction, upload a photo/video and rate the outcome. Not only is does this reflect the quality of professionalism from both individuals, it enacts a preventative measure to ensure ratings, whether positive or negative are verified from codied deals that were stuck, reducing the ability for bots and fringe groups to target individuals.</li></ul>
            <span style="font-size: 1em;">&nbsp;</span>
    
  <li><strong>Ensure fairness and transparency</strong>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
        Montractors often face high advertising costs, while clients struggle to compare service quality and pricing with other possibilities other than the major providers</li></ul>
            <span style="font-size: 1em;">&nbsp;</span>
    
  <li><strong>Bidding Option</strong>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
        Most contracts on the larger scale, such as government contracts offer a bidding option to find the best price for the work they want done; why shouldn’t this be the case for smaller ones as well?</ul></li>
</ul>
<br> 

Handyman Helper creates an environment built on credibility, accountability, and simplicity. By integrating verified profiles, documented credentials, and a transparent bidding system, the platform provides a fair marketplace for skilled workers to find consistent clients—and for clients to confidently choose who enters their homes.<br> 
<br> 
This project directly meets market demand for trustworthy, efficient, and affordable home service solutions while contributing to local economic growth.
